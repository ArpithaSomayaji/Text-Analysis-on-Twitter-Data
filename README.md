Sentimental Analysis and Topic Modelling 

The purpose of this exercise is to get a sense of the sentiments about recent controversy surrounding the kneeling of NFL players during the National Anthem. It would be interesting to see the sentiments associated with tweets from different parts of the country. You are required to do the following:
a)	Use the Twitter API (Twython, Twitter, Tweepy, or any other Python-Twitter module) to download about 20,000 tweets related to this controversy (hashtags, such as #TakeTheKnee, #TakeAKnee, #boycottnfl, etc. may be used for this purpose)
b)	Aggregate tweets from a particular state and calculate the overall sentiment associated with each state. Sentiments may be calculated using: 1) AFFIN11.txt (see Blackboard); 2) the Hu & Liu lexicon of positive and negative words; or 3) TextBlob.
c)	Do a topic analysis on the entire set of tweets. You may choose 10 topics to extract from your topic modeling software â€“ try NMF.
